  abstract={We present an evolutionary algorithm which predicts stable atomic structures and phase diagrams by searching the energy landscape of empirical and ab initio Hamiltonians. Composition and geometrical degrees of freedom may be varied simultaneously. We show that this method utilizes information from favorable local structure at one composition to predict that at others, achieving far greater efficiency of phase diagram prediction than a method which relies on sampling compositions individually. We detail this and a number of other efficiency-improving techniques implemented in the genetic algorithm for structure prediction code that is now publicly available. We test the efficiency of the software by searching the ternary Zr–Cu–Al system using an empirical embedded-atom model potential. In addition to testing the algorithm, we also evaluate the accuracy of the potential itself. We find that the potential stabilizes several correct ternary phases, while a few of the predicted ground states are unphysical. Our results suggest that genetic algorithm searches can be used to improve the methodology of empirical potential design.}

The 2-fold coordinated intra-layer vacancy is the lowest cost vacancy and forms a deep level 1.5eV below the conduction band edge. The 3-fold intra-layer vacancy and the 2-fold inter-layer vacancy are higher cost defects, and form shallower levels. The unusual bonding rearrangements lead to low oxygen migration barriers, which are useful for resistive random access memory applications.},

abstract = {The complete set of partial pair distribution functions for a rare earth oxide liquid are measured by combining aerodynamic levitation, neutron and x-ray diffraction on Y2O3, and Ho2O3 melts at 2870 K. The average Y-O (or Ho-O) coordination of these isomorphic melts is measured to be 5.5(2), which is significantly less than the octahedral coordination of crystalline Y2O3 (or Ho2O3). Investigation of La2O3, ZrO2, and Al2O3 melts by x-ray diffraction and molecular dynamics simulations also show lower-than-crystal cation-oxygen coordination. These measurements suggest a general trend towards lower coordination compared to their crystalline counterparts. It is found that the coordination drop is larger for lower field strength, larger radius cations and is negligible for high field strength (network forming) cations, such as SiO2. These findings have broad implications for predicting the local structure and related physical properties of metal-oxide melts and oxide glasses.},

abstract = {Dramatic advances in the understanding of x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) have been made over the past few decades, which have led ultimately to a highly quantitative theory. This review covers these developments from a unified multiple-scattering viewpoint. The authors focus on extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) well above an x-ray edge, and, to a lesser extent, on x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) closer to an edge. The discussion includes both formal considerations, derived from a many-electron formulation, and practical computational methods based on independent-electron models, with many-body effects lumped into various inelastic losses and energy shifts. The main conceptual issues in XAFS theory are identified and their relative importance is assessed; these include the convergence of the multiple-scattering expansion, curved-wave effects, the scattering potential, inelastic losses, self-energy shifts, and vibrations and structural disorder. The advantages and limitations of current computational approaches are addressed, with particular regard to quantitative experimental comparisons.},

abstract = {Pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of neutron or X-ray powder diffraction data is a useful technique for analysis of short-range structure in both amorphous and crystalline materials. Errors in PDF determinations may arise from several sources: termination of the Fourier transform, lack of instrument resolution, counting statistics and inaccurate corrections for experimental artifacts. Estimates of the amount of error from termination and instrument resolution are computed using a model structure. A general method for estimating the expected contribution of statistical error to the PDF is introduced for the first time. The effect of termination varies with the type of material and with the amplitude of lattice vibrations but, in general, termination with Q > 30 A produces minimal errors. Broadening of the diffraction pattern produces negligible effect for conventional instrumentation. With moderate data-collection times, the statistical errors can be reduced to reasonable levels. Pulsed-neutron diffraction can provide accurate and precise PDF measurements, as is demonstrated in this work by the agreement between model and experimental results for polycrystalline aluminium.},

Subsequent noninteractive data processing provides maps of the diffraction profiles, thin film fiber texture, and composition. Even for highly textured films, our diffraction technique provides detection of diffraction from each family of Bragg reflections, which affords direct comparison of the measured profiles with powder patterns of known phases. These techniques are important for high throughput combinatorial studies as they provide structure and composition maps which may be correlated with performance trends within an inorganic library.},

abstract = {It is widely believed that the continuous random network (CRN) model represents the structural topology of amorphous silicon. The key evidence is that the model can reproduce well experimental reduced density functions (RDFs) obtained by diffraction. By using a combination of electron diffraction and fluctuation electron microscopy (FEM) variance data as experimental constraints in a structural relaxation procedure, we show that the CRN is not unique in matching the experimental RDF. We find that inhomogeneous paracrystalline structures containing local cubic ordering at the 10 to 20 angstrom length scale are also fully consistent with the RDF data. Crucially, they also matched the FEM variance data, unlike the CRN model. The paracrystalline model has implications for understanding phase transformation processes in various materials that extend beyond amorphous silicon.},

@article{Wang2003a,
abstract = {Enhancement of polarization and related properties in heteroepitaxially constrained thin films of the ferroelectromagnet, BiFeO3, is reported. Structure analysis indicates that the crystal structure of film is monoclinic in contrast to bulk, which is rhombohedral. The films display a room-temperature spontaneous polarization (50 to 60 microcoulombs per square centimeter) almost an order of magnitude higher than that of the bulk (6.1 microcoulombs per square centimeter). The observed enhancement is corroborated by first-principles calculations and found to originate from a high sensitivity of the polarization to small changes in lattice parameters. The films also exhibit enhanced thickness-dependent magnetism compared with the bulk. These enhanced and combined functional responses in thin film form present an opportunity to create and implement thin film devices that actively couple the magnetic and ferroelectric order parameters.},

@article{Yao2010a,
abstract = {Because of its excellent dielectric properties, silicon oxide (SiO(x)) has long been used and considered as a passive, insulating component in the construction of electronic devices. In contrast, here we demonstrate resistive switches and memories that use SiO(x) as the sole active material and can be implemented in entirely metal-free embodiments. Through cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy, we determine that the switching takes place through the voltage-driven formation and modification of silicon (Si) nanocrystals (NCs) embedded in the SiO(x) matrix, with SiO(x) itself also serving as the source of the formation of this Si pathway. The small sizes of the Si NCs (d ∼ 5 nm) suggest that scaling to ultrasmall domains could be feasible. Meanwhile, the switch also shows robust nonvolatile properties, high ON/OFF ratios (>10(5)), fast switching (sub-100-ns), and good endurance (10(4) write-erase cycles). These properties in a SiO(x)-based material composition showcase its potentials in constructing memory or logic devices that are fully CMOS compatible.},

@article{McBride2003a,
abstract = {Using a conventional transmission electron microscope that incorporates a field emission gun it is possible to focus an electron beam to form a small probe (<1nm full-width at half-maximum). Such a probe can then be used to perform high spatial resolution diffraction experiments. The high spatial resolution allows technologically interesting amorphous volumes, such as those found in glassy intergranular phases or in semiconductor implantations, to be investigated directly. In order to achieve the probe characteristics necessary to investigate nanovolumes of material the probe must be highly convergent which results in it being highly coherent. In this paper we examine the effect of coherent convergent illumination on electron diffraction data taken from nanovolumes of amorphous material. It is shown that, for amorphous volumes as small as 1.2nm in diameter, the additional interference effects induced in the diffraction data by the use of coherent convergent illumination are largely suppressed by the lack of order in amorphous materials. This allows the use of deconvolution techniques, developed for the correction of broadening of the diffraction pattern in the case of incoherent illumination, and the subsequent application of reduced density function (G(r)) analysis, to also be used for coherent illumination.},

abstract = {Disagreement or inconsistencies in mammographic interpretation motivates utilizing computerized pattern recognition algorithms to aid the assessment of radiographic features. We have studied the potential for using artificial neural networks (ANNs) to analyze interpreted radiographic features from film screen mammograms. Attention was given to 216 cases (mammogram series) that presented suspicious characteristics. The domain expert (Wasson) quantified up to 12 radiographic features for each case based on guidelines from previous literature. Patient age was also included. The existence or absence of malignancy was confirmed in each case via open surgical biopsy (111 malignant, 105 benign). ANNs of various complexity were trained via evolutionary programming to indicate whether or not a malignancy was present given a vector of scored input features in a statistical cross validation procedure. For suspicious masses, the best evolved ANNs generated a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AZ) of 0.9196 +/- 0.0040 (1 S.E.), with a mean specificity of 0.6269 +/- 0.0272 at 0.95 sensitivity. Results when microcalcifications were included were not quite as good (AZ = 0.8464), however, ANNs with only two hidden nodes performed as well as more complex ANNs and better than ANNs with only one hidden node. The performance of the evolved ANNs was comparable to prior literature, but with an order of magnitude less complexity. The success of small ANNs in diagnosing breast cancer offers the promise that suitable explanations for the ANN's behavior can be induced, leading to a greater acceptance by physicians.},

@article{VanDover1999,
abstract = {Parallel synthesis together with high-throughput screening was used to identify candidate materials for integrated circuit applications that demand a superior high permittivity dielectric thin film. Specifically, we developed a "continuous-composition spread" (CCS) technique to synthesize much of a pseudoternary oxide system in a single deposition and used this in conjunction with a high-throughput measurement protocol, thereby allowing each chemical system to be deposited and evaluated in about 24 h. This approach led to the identification of compositions in the Zr-Sn-Ti-O system with promising properties. The same technique was used to determine the optimum compositions as a function of processing parameters. Films with the composition Zr(.2)Sn(.2)Ti(.6)O(2) were then prepared using a conventional synthetic technique (on-axis sputtering) and were verified to have excellent properties. Thus, the CCS technique has demonstrated utility in rapidly identifying and developing a useful new material.},

abstract = {In this paper a method for collecting electron diffraction patterns using a Gatan imaging filter is presented. The method enables high-quality diffraction data to be measured at scattering angles comparable to those that can be obtained using X-ray and neutron diffraction. In addition, the method offers the capability for examining small regions of sample in, for example, thin films and nano-structures. Using X-ray, neutron and electron diffraction data collected from the same sample, we demonstrate quantitative agreement between all three. We also present a novel method for obtaining the single scattering contribution to the total diffracted intensity by collecting data at various electron wavelengths. This approach allows pair distribution functions to be determined from electron diffraction in cases where there exists significant multiple scattering.},

abstract = {A memristor is a two-terminal electronic device whose conductance can be precisely modulated by charge or flux through it. Here we experimentally demonstrate a nanoscale silicon-based memristor device and show that a hybrid system composed of complementary metal-oxide semiconductor neurons and memristor synapses can support important synaptic functions such as spike timing dependent plasticity. Using memristors as synapses in neuromorphic circuits can potentially offer both high connectivity and high density required for efficient computing.},

abstract = {Metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors, formed using silicon dioxide and silicon, have undergone four decades of staggering technological advancement. With fundamental limits to this technology close at hand, alternatives to silicon dioxide are being pursued to enable new functionality and device architectures. We achieved ferroelectric functionality in intimate contact with silicon by growing coherently strained strontium titanate (SrTiO3) films via oxide molecular beam epitaxy in direct contact with silicon, with no interfacial silicon dioxide. We observed ferroelectricity in these ultrathin SrTiO3 layers by means of piezoresponse force microscopy. Stable ferroelectric nanodomains created in SrTiO3 were observed at temperatures as high as 400 kelvin.},

abstract = {Resistance switching in metal oxides could form the basis for next-generation non-volatile memory. It has been argued that the current in the high-conductivity state of several technologically relevant oxide materials flows through localized filaments, but these filaments have been characterized only indirectly, limiting our understanding of the switching mechanism. Here, we use high-resolution transmission electron microscopy to probe directly the nanofilaments in a Pt/TiO(2)/Pt system during resistive switching. In situ current-voltage and low-temperature (approximately 130 K) conductivity measurements confirm that switching occurs by the formation and disruption of Ti(n)O(2n-1) (or so-called Magn\'{e}li phase) filaments. Knowledge of the composition, structure and dimensions of these filaments will provide a foundation for unravelling the full mechanism of resistance switching in oxide thin films, and help guide research into the stability and scalability of such films for applications.},

@article{Ohno2011,
abstract = {Memory is believed to occur in the human brain as a result of two types of synaptic plasticity: short-term plasticity (STP) and long-term potentiation (LTP; refs 1-4). In neuromorphic engineering, emulation of known neural behaviour has proven to be difficult to implement in software because of the highly complex interconnected nature of thought processes. Here we report the discovery of a Ag(2)S inorganic synapse, which emulates the synaptic functions of both STP and LTP characteristics through the use of input pulse repetition time. The structure known as an atomic switch, operating at critical voltages, stores information as STP with a spontaneous decay of conductance level in response to intermittent input stimuli, whereas frequent stimulation results in a transition to LTP. The Ag(2)S inorganic synapse has interesting characteristics with analogies to an individual biological synapse, and achieves dynamic memorization in a single device without the need of external preprogramming. A psychological model related to the process of memorizing and forgetting is also demonstrated using the inorganic synapses. Our Ag(2)S element indicates a breakthrough in mimicking synaptic behaviour essential for the further creation of artificial neural systems that emulate characteristics of human memory.},

abstract = {The structure of a new layered oxyfluoride, viz. potassium strontium diniobium hexaoxide fluoride, KSrNb(2)O(6)F, was refined from powder neutron diffraction data in the orthorhombic space group Immm. The oxyfluoride compound is an n = 2 member of the Dion-Jacobson-type family of general formula A[A'(n-1)B(n)X(3n+1)], which consists of double layered perovskite slabs, [SrNb(2)O(6)F](-), between which K(+) ions are located. Within the perovskite slabs, the NbO(5)F octahedra are significantly distorted and tilted about the a axis. A bond-valence-sum calculation gives evidence for O/F ordering in KSrNb(2)O(6)F, with the F(-) ions located in the central sites of the corner-sharing NbO(5)F octahedra along the b axis. All atoms lie on special positions, namely Nb on m, Sr on mmm, K on m2m, F on mm2, and O on sites of symmetry m and m2m.},

abstract = {Fluctuation electron microscopy is a technique for studying medium-range order in disordered materials. We present an implementation of fluctuation microscopy using nanodiffraction in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) at a spatial resolution varying from 0.8 to 5.0 nm. Compared to conventional TEM (CTEM), the STEM-based technique offers a denser scattering vector sampling at a reduced sample dose and easier access to variable resolution information. We have reproduced results on amorphous silicon previously obtained by CTEM-based fluctuation microscopy, and report initial variable-resolution measurements on amorphous germanium.},

Epitaxial films that are grown on LaAIO(3) substrates by laser ablation and suitably heat treated exhibit magnetoresistance values as high as 127,000 percent near 77 kelvin and approximately 1300 percent near room temperature. Such a phenomenon could be useful for various magnetic and electric device applications if the observed effects of material processing are optimized.

abstract = {We report on the coupling between ferroelectric and magnetic order parameters in a nanostructured BaTiO3-CoFe2O4 ferroelectromagnet. This facilitates the interconversion of energies stored in electric and magnetic fields and plays an important role in many devices, including transducers, field sensors, etc. Such nanostructures were deposited on single-crystal SrTiO3 (001) substrates by pulsed laser deposition from a single Ba-Ti-Co-Fe-oxide target. The films are epitaxial in-plane as well as out-of-plane with self-assembled hexagonal arrays of CoFe2O4 nanopillars embedded in a BaTiO3 matrix. The CoFe2O4 nanopillars have uniform size and average spacing of 20 to 30 nanometers. Temperature-dependent magnetic measurements illustrate the coupling between the two order parameters, which is manifested as a change in magnetization at the ferroelectric Curie temperature. Thermodynamic analyses show that the magnetoelectric coupling in such a nanostructure can be understood on the basis of the strong elastic interactions between the two phases.},

In the present note we argue that both are wrong and suggest instead alternative models: 1) that commensurate ferroelectrics satisfy a log-normal distribution of Curie temperatures; and 2) that incommensurate systems may more often than is recognized exhibit a Devil's staircase of transition that manifest themselves in subtle experiments (especially ultrasonic attenuation) as slightly aperiodic sequences of phases.},

@article{Franklin2012,
abstract = {Although carbon nanotube (CNT) transistors have been promoted for years as a replacement for silicon technology, there is limited theoretical work and no experimental reports on how nanotubes will perform at sub-10 nm channel lengths. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the first sub-10 nm CNT transistor, which is shown to outperform the best competing silicon devices with more than four times the diameter-normalized current density (2.41 mA/$\mu$m) at a low operating voltage of 0.5 V. The nanotube transistor exhibits an impressively small inverse subthreshold slope of 94 mV/decade-nearly half of the value expected from a previous theoretical study. Numerical simulations show the critical role of the metal-CNT contacts in determining the performance of sub-10 nm channel length transistors, signifying the need for more accurate theoretical modeling of transport between the metal and nanotube. The superior low-voltage performance of the sub-10 nm CNT transistor proves the viability of nanotubes for consideration in future aggressively scaled transistor technologies.},

abstract = {Ferroelectric materials are widely used in modern electric devices such as memory elements, filtering devices and high-performance insulators. Ferroelectric crystals have a spontaneous electric polarization arising from the coherent arrangement of electric dipoles (specifically, a polar displacement of anions and cations). First-principles calculations and electron density analysis of ferroelectric materials have revealed that the covalent bond between the anions and cations, or the orbital hybridization of electrons on both ions, plays a key role in establishing the dipolar arrangement. However, an alternative model-electronic ferroelectricity-has been proposed in which the electric dipole depends on electron correlations, rather than the covalency. This would offer the attractive possibility of ferroelectric materials that could be controlled by the charge, spin and orbital degrees of freedom of the electron. Here we report experimental evidence for ferroelectricity arising from electron correlations in the triangular mixed valence oxide, LuFe(2)O(4). Using resonant X-ray scattering measurements, we determine the ordering of the Fe(2+) and Fe(3+) ions. They form a superstructure that supports an electric polarization consisting of distributed electrons of polar symmetry. The polar ordering arises from the repulsive property of electrons-electron correlations-acting on a frustrated geometry.},

We review recent progress in the growth, characterization and understanding of thin-film multiferroics. The availability of high-quality thin-film multiferroics makes it easier to tailor their properties through epitaxial strain, atomic-level engineering of chemistry and interfacial coupling, and is a prerequisite for their incorporation into practical devices. We discuss novel device paradigms based on magnetoelectric coupling, and outline the key scientific challenges in the field.},

@article{VanAken2004,
abstract = {Understanding the ferroelectrocity in magnetic ferroelectric oxides is of both fundamental and technological importance. Here, we identify the nature of the ferroelectric phase transition in the hexagonal manganite, YMnO(3), using a combination of single-crystal X-ray diffraction, thorough structure analysis and first-principles density-functional calculations. The ferroelectric phase is characterized by a buckling of the layered MnO(5) polyhedra, accompanied by displacements of the Y ions, which lead to a net electric polarization. Our calculations show that the mechanism is driven entirely by electrostatic and size effects, rather than the usual changes in chemical bonding associated with ferroelectric phase transitions in perovskite oxides. As a result, the usual indicators of structural instability, such as anomalies in Born effective charges on the active ions, do not hold. In contrast to the chemically stabilized ferroelectrics, this mechanism for ferroelectricity permits the coexistence of magnetism and ferroelectricity, and so suggests an avenue for designing novel magnetic ferroelectrics.},

@article{Lee2011,
abstract = {Numerous candidates attempting to replace Si-based flash memory have failed for a variety of reasons over the years. Oxide-based resistance memory and the related memristor have succeeded in surpassing the specifications for a number of device requirements. However, a material or device structure that satisfies high-density, switching-speed, endurance, retention and most importantly power-consumption criteria has yet to be announced. In this work we demonstrate a TaO(x)-based asymmetric passive switching device with which we were able to localize resistance switching and satisfy all aforementioned requirements. In particular, the reduction of switching current drastically reduces power consumption and results in extreme cycling endurances of over 10(12). Along with the 10 ns switching times, this allows for possible applications to the working-memory space as well. Furthermore, by combining two such devices each with an intrinsic Schottky barrier we eliminate any need for a discrete transistor or diode in solving issues of stray leakage current paths in high-density crossbar arrays.},

Arrays containing different combinations, stoichiometries, and deposition sequences of BaCO(3), Bi(2)O(3), CaO, CuO, PbO, SrCO(3), and Y(2)O(3) were generated with a series of binary masks. The arrays were sintered and BiSrCaCuO and YBaCuO superconducting films were identified. Samples as small as 200 micrometers by 200 micrometers in size were generated, corresponding to library densities of 10,000 sites per square inch. The ability to generate and screen combinatorial libraries of solid-state compounds, when coupled with theory and empirical observations, may significantly increase the rate at which novel electronic, magnetic, and optical materials are discovered and theoretical predictions tested.},

@article{Schneider2008,
abstract = {Structural data play a central role in understanding biological function at the molecular level. At present, the majority of high-resolution structural data about biological macromolecules and their complexes originates from crystallography. In crystal structure determination, the major hurdle to overcome is the production of crystals of sufficient size and quality. High-flux x-ray beams with diameters of a few micrometers or less help to alleviate this problem as small beams allow the use of small crystals or scanning of large crystals for regions of acceptable diffraction. Using sophisticated x-ray optics and mechanics with submicrometer precision, Riekel et al.[Acta Crystallogr., Sect. D: Biol. Crystallogr., 64, 158-166 (2008)], have recently demonstrated that an x-ray beam of 1 mum can be used to determine the crystal structure of a protein to a resolution of 1.5 A. The smallest volume from which usable diffraction data were collected amounted to 20 mum(3), corresponding to not more than 2x10(8) unit cells. In a diffraction volume of micrometer dimensions, radiation damage is expected to be reduced with respect to large volumes as a significant fraction of the photoelectrons produced by the incident radiation escapes from the diffracting volume before dissipating their energy. The possibility to make use of small andor inhomogeneous crystals in combination with a possible reduction in radiation damage due to size effects has the potential to make many more systems amenable to crystal structure analysis.},

abstract = {Anyone who ever took an electronics laboratory class will be familiar with the fundamental passive circuit elements: the resistor, the capacitor and the inductor. However, in 1971 Leon Chua reasoned from symmetry arguments that there should be a fourth fundamental element, which he called a memristor (short for memory resistor). Although he showed that such an element has many interesting and valuable circuit properties, until now no one has presented either a useful physical model or an example of a memristor. Here we show, using a simple analytical example, that memristance arises naturally in nanoscale systems in which solid-state electronic and ionic transport are coupled under an external bias voltage. These results serve as the foundation for understanding a wide range of hysteretic current-voltage behaviour observed in many nanoscale electronic devices that involve the motion of charged atomic or molecular species, in particular certain titanium dioxide cross-point switches.},

abstract = {Resistance switching in metal oxides could form the basis for next-generation non-volatile memory. It has been argued that the current in the high-conductivity state of several technologically relevant oxide materials flows through localized filaments, but these filaments have been characterized only indirectly, limiting our understanding of the switching mechanism. Here, we use high-resolution transmission electron microscopy to probe directly the nanofilaments in a Pt/TiO(2)/Pt system during resistive switching. In situ current-voltage and low-temperature (approximately 130 K) conductivity measurements confirm that switching occurs by the formation and disruption of Ti(n)O(2n-1) (or so-called Magn\'{e}li phase) filaments. Knowledge of the composition, structure and dimensions of these filaments will provide a foundation for unravelling the full mechanism of resistance switching in oxide thin films, and help guide research into the stability and scalability of such films for applications.},

Examples include nanoparticles, species encapsulated in mesoporous hosts, and bulk crystals with intrinsic nanoscale order. The powerful methods that we have for solving the atomic structure of bulk crystals fail for such materials. Currently, no broadly applicable, quantitative, and robust methods exist to replace crystallography at the nanoscale. We provide an overview of various classes of nanostructured materials and review the methods that are currently used to study their structure. We suggest that successful solutions to these nanostructure problems will involve interactions among researchers from materials science, physics, chemistry, computer science, and applied mathematics, working within a "complex modeling" paradigm that combines theory and experiment in a self-consistent computational framework.},

Ferroelectricity and magnetism tend to be mutually exclusive and interact weakly with each other when they coexist. The exciting new development is the discovery that even a weak magnetoelectric interaction can lead to spectacular cross-coupling effects when it induces electric polarization in a magnetically ordered state. Such magnetic ferroelectricity, showing an unprecedented sensitivity to ap plied magnetic fields, occurs in 'frustrated magnets' with competing interactions between spins and complex magnetic orders. We summarize key experimental findings and the current theoretical understanding of these phenomena, which have great potential for tuneable multifunctional devices.},

@article{Biswal2010,
abstract = {Although it is being successfully implemented for exploration of the genome, discovery science has eluded the functional neuroimaging community. The core challenge remains the development of common paradigms for interrogating the myriad functional systems in the brain without the constraints of a priori hypotheses. Resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) constitutes a candidate approach capable of addressing this challenge. Imaging the brain during rest reveals large-amplitude spontaneous low-frequency (<0.1 Hz) fluctuations in the fMRI signal that are temporally correlated across functionally related areas. Referred to as functional connectivity, these correlations yield detailed maps of complex neural systems, collectively constituting an individual's "functional connectome." Reproducibility across datasets and individuals suggests the functional connectome has a common architecture, yet each individual's functional connectome exhibits unique features, with stable, meaningful interindividual differences in connectivity patterns and strengths. Comprehensive mapping of the functional connectome, and its subsequent exploitation to discern genetic influences and brain-behavior relationships, will require multicenter collaborative datasets. Here we initiate this endeavor by gathering R-fMRI data from 1,414 volunteers collected independently at 35 international centers. We demonstrate a universal architecture of positive and negative functional connections, as well as consistent loci of inter-individual variability. Age and sex emerged as significant determinants. These results demonstrate that independent R-fMRI datasets can be aggregated and shared. High-throughput R-fMRI can provide quantitative phenotypes for molecular genetic studies and biomarkers of developmental and pathological processes in the brain. To initiate discovery science of brain function, the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project dataset is freely accessible at www.nitrc.org/projects/fcon\_1000/.},

abstract = {The magnetoelectric effect--the induction of magnetization by means of an electric field and induction of polarization by means of a magnetic field--was first presumed to exist by Pierre Curie, and subsequently attracted a great deal of interest in the 1960s and 1970s (refs 2-4). More recently, related studies on magnetic ferroelectrics have signalled a revival of interest in this phenomenon. From a technological point of view, the mutual control of electric and magnetic properties is an attractive possibility, but the number of candidate materials is limited and the effects are typically too small to be useful in applications. Here we report the discovery of ferroelectricity in a perovskite manganite, TbMnO3, where the effect of spin frustration causes sinusoidal antiferromagnetic ordering. The modulated magnetic structure is accompanied by a magnetoelastically induced lattice modulation, and with the emergence of a spontaneous polarization. In the magnetic ferroelectric TbMnO3, we found gigantic magnetoelectric and magnetocapacitance effects, which can be attributed to switching of the electric polarization induced by magnetic fields. Frustrated spin systems therefore provide a new area to search for magnetoelectric media.},

@article{Kim2006,
abstract = {Numerous studies of the ionic conductivities in oxide-doped chalcogenaide glasses have shown the anomalous result that the ionic conductivity actually increases significantly (by more than a factor of 10 in some cases) by the initial addition of an oxide phase to a pure sulfide glass. After this initial sharp increase, the conductivity then monotonically decreases with further oxide addition. While this behavior is important to the application of these glasses for Li batteries, no definitive understanding of this behavior has been elucidated. To examine this effect further and more completely, the ionic conductivities of 0.5Li(2)S + 0.5[(1 - x)GeS(2) + xGeO(2)] glasses have been measured on disc-type bulk glasses. The ionic conductivity of the 0.5Li(2)S + 0.5GeS(2) (x = 0) glass was observed to increase from 4.3 x 10(-5) (Omega cm)(-1) to 1.5 x 10(-4) (Omega cm)(-1) while the activation energy decreased to 0.358 eV from 0.385 eV by the addition of 5 mol \% of GeO(2). Further addition of GeO(2) monotonically decreased the conductivity and increased the activation energy. On the basis of our previous studies of the structure of this glass system, the Anderson and Stuart model was applied to explain the decrease in the activation energy and increase in the conductivity. It is suggested that the "doorway" radius between adjacent cation sites increases slightly (from approximately 0.29(+/-0.05) A to approximately 0.40(+/-0.05) A) with the addition of oxygen to the glass and is proposed to be the major cause in decreasing the activation energy and thereby increasing the conductivity. Further addition of oxides appears to contract the glass structure (and the doorway radius) leading to an increase in the conductivity activation energy and a decrease in the conductivity.},

abstract = {The electronic structure and modification of the local interatomic structure of a reactive sputtered amorphous tantalum oxide (a-TaO(x)) thin film with the variation of oxygen nonstoichiometry, x in a-TaO(x) have been investigated by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), Raman scattering spectroscopy, and Rutherford back scattering spectroscopy. A parallel chemical shift of Ta4f(7/2) and O1s core levels observed with the variation of x indicates the Fermi level shift by reduction and oxidation in the framework of the rigid band model. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) suggests both the increase of average coordination number of the first Ta-O shell in polyhedra and a considerable reduction of the average Ta-O bond length with the increase of x. The relative intensity of Raman shift peaks at 670 cm(-1) and 815 cm(-1), corresponding to Ta-O stretching of TaO(6) octahedra and TaO(5) probably with a pyramidal form, respectively, drastically changes between x = 2.47 to 1.86, suggesting the change in the predominant polyhedron from TaO(6) to TaO(5) with a modification in multiplicity of oxygen by the reorganization of the polyhedral network.},

@article{Schwierz2010,
abstract = {Graphene has changed from being the exclusive domain of condensed-matter physicists to being explored by those in the electron-device community. In particular, graphene-based transistors have developed rapidly and are now considered an option for post-silicon electronics. However, many details about the potential performance of graphene transistors in real applications remain unclear. Here I review the properties of graphene that are relevant to electron devices, discuss the trade-offs among these properties and examine their effects on the performance of graphene transistors in both logic and radiofrequency applications. I conclude that the excellent mobility of graphene may not, as is often assumed, be its most compelling feature from a device perspective. Rather, it may be the possibility of making devices with channels that are extremely thin that will allow graphene field-effect transistors to be scaled to shorter channel lengths and higher speeds without encountering the adverse short-channel effects that restrict the performance of existing devices. Outstanding challenges for graphene transistors include opening a sizeable and well-defined bandgap in graphene, making large-area graphene transistors that operate in the current-saturation regime and fabricating graphene nanoribbons with well-defined widths and clean edges.},
